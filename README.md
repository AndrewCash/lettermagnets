Determine if a phrase has more than a given number of a single letter.


The door to my room is covered in magnetic letters you would find on a refridgerator.
I only have five packs of letters so I can't put phrases on the door with a letter that shows up more than five times.
This program lets me know if a phrase I might want to put on the door is possible.
