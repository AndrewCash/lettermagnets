Determine if a phrase has more than a given number of a single letter.


The door to my room is covered in magnetic letters you would find on a refridgerator.
I only have five packs of letters so I can't put phrases on the door with a letter that shows up more than five times.
This program lets me know if a phrase I might want to put on the door is possible.


TODO:
- Add functionality to use a different letter if one letter is used up. For example, if all the 'A's are used then you could use an upside down 'V' instead. This could allow you to make longer phrases that use a lot of vowels and fewer uses of letters such as 'Q'.
